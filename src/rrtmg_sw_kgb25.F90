!     The array KA contains absorption coefs at the 16 chosen g-values 
!     for a range of pressure levels> ~100mb, temperatures, and binary
!     species parameters (see taumol.f for definition).  The first 
!     index in the array, JS, runs from 1 to 9, and corresponds to 
!     different values of the binary species parameter.  For instance, 
!     JS=1 refers to dry air, JS = 2 corresponds to the paramter value 1/8, 
!     JS = 3 corresponds to the parameter value 2/8, etc.  The second index
!     in the array, JT, which runs from 1 to 5, corresponds to different
!     temperatures.  More specifically, JT = 3 means that the data are for
!     the reference temperature TREF for this  pressure level, JT = 2 refers
!     to TREF-15, JT = 1 is for TREF-30, JT = 4 is for TREF+15, and JT = 5
!     is for TREF+30.  The third index, JP, runs from 1 to 13 and refers
!     to the JPth reference pressure level (see taumol.f for these levels
!     in mb).  The fourth index, IG, goes from 1 to 16, and indicates
!     which g-interval the absorption coefficients are for.
