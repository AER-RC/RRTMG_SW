******************************************************************************

This directory contains the source code and sample makefile necessary to run
RRTMG_SW version 1.0, a correlated k-distribution shortwave radiative transfer 
model developed at AER, Inc for application to GCMs.  This version of RRTMG_SW 
utilizes a two-stream radiative transfer method as implemented at ECMWF. Two
modes of operation are possible.  RRTMG_SW can be run in stand-alone mode using 
the input files and source modules described below, or it can be attached to an 
atmospheric general circulation model as a callable subroutine. 

The version of RRTMG_SW provided here utilizes the full complement of 224 
g-points used in the standard RRTM_SW.  No g-point reduction or other
performance enhancements have been completed for this code.  Total fluxes are
accurate to within 1.5 W/m2 relative to the standard RRTM_SW (using DISORT) 
in clear sky and within 10 W/m2 in cloudy sky.  RRTM_SW with DISORT is itself
accurate to within 1 W/m2 of the data-validated multiple scattering model, CHARTS.
