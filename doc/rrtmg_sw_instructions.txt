 RECORD 1.1
 
      CXID:  80 characters of user identification  (80A1)
 
            CXID(1) is the flag which determines program initialization and termination.  
                    The actual input data stream for RRTM commences with the record 
                    containing a '$' in CXID(1).  Any records that are read prior to a 
                    record containing a '$' in CXID(1) are ignored.

                        ECAER, must be set manually in the main source module, 
                        rrtmg_sw.1col.f90, to activate the aerosols with this option.

                       (requires the presence of file IN_AER_RRTM)

	  IMCA   (0,1) flag for McICA (Monte Carlo Independent Column Approximation)
                       for statistical representation of sub-grid cloud fraction 
                       and cloud overlap
                  = 0  standard forward calculation; do not use McICA (valid for
                       clear or overcast conditions only)
                  = 1  use McICA (will perform statistical sample of 200 forward
                       calculations and output average flux and heating rates)
  
	  ICLD   (0,1,2,3) flag for clouds     
                  = 0  no cloudy layers in atmosphere
                  = 1  one or more cloudy layers present in atmosphere.  Cloud layers
                       are treated as overcast only for IMCA = 0, or they are treated
                       using a RANDOM overlap assumption for IMCA = 1.
                       (requires the presence of file IN_CLD_RRTM for column model)

                       (available only for IMCA = 1)
  
  Measurement comparison flags:
          IDELM  (0,1) flag for outputting downwelling fluxes computed using the delta-M scaling approximation
                  = 0  output "true" direct and diffuse downwelling fluxes (default)
                  = 1  output direct and diffuse downwelling fluxes computed with delta-M approximation
                 (Note:  The delta-M approximation is always used internally in RRTMG_SW to compute the total
                 downwelling flux at each level.  What the IDELM flag determines is whether the components 
                 of the downwelling flux, the direct and diffuse fluxes, that are output are the actual direct
                 and diffuse fluxes (IDELM = 0) or are those computed using the delta-M approximation (IDELM = 1).

          ICOS   = 0 there is no need to account for instrumental cosine response (default)
                 = 1 to account for instrumental cosine response in the computation of the direct and diffuse fluxes 
                     (unavailable)
                 = 2 to account for instrumental cosine response in the computation of the diffuse fluxes only
                     (unavailable)
                 (Note:  ICOS = 1 and ICOS = 2 requires the presence of the file COSINE_RESPONSE, which should 
                 consist of lines containing pairs of numbers (ANG, COSFAC), where COSFAC is the instrumental cosine
                 response at the angle ANG.)

        JULDAT       Julian day associated with calculation (1-365/366 starting January 1).
	             Used to calculate Earth distance from sun. A value of 0 (default) indicates no scaling
	             of solar source function using earth-sun distance.

        SZA          Solar zenith angle in degrees (0 deg is overhead).

        ISOLVAR      Solar variability option

		     = 0 each band uses standard solar source function, corresponding
                         to present day conditions.

		     = 1 scale solar source function, each band will have the same
                         scale factor applied, (equal to SOLVAR(16))

		     = 2 scale solar source function, each band has different scale
	 	         factors (for band IB, equal to SOLVAR(IB))

	SOLVAR       the solar source function scale factor for each band.  If 
	             ISOLVAR = 1, only the first value of SOLVAR (SOLVAR(16)) is 
                     considered.  If ISOLVAR = 2, values must be provided for all bands.

        (Note:  surface reflectance = 1 - surface emissivity) 

         IEMIS  = 0 each band has surface emissivity equal to 1.0
                = 1 each band has the same surface emissivity (equal to SEMISS(16)) 
                = 2 each band has different surface emissivity (for band IB, equal to SEMISS(IB))

         IREFLECT = 0 for Lambertian reflection at surface, i.e. reflected radiance 
			is equal at all angles
                  = 1 for specular reflection at surface, i.e. reflected radiance at angle
			is equal to downward surface radiance at same angle multiplied by
			the reflectance.  THIS OPTION CURRENTLY NOT IMPLEMENTED.

         SEMISS   the surface emissivity for each band (see Table I).  All values must be 
                  greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.  If IEMIS = 1, only
                  the first value of SEMISS (SEMISS(16)) is considered.  If IEMIS = 2 
                  and no surface emissivity value is given for SEMISS(IB), a value of 1.0 
                  is used for band IB.

              function of wavelength, as described below:
   
        AOD = AOD1 * (AERPAR(2) + AERPAR(3) * (lambda/lambda1)) /
                       ((AERPAR(2) + AERPAR(3) - 1) + (lambda/lambda1)**AERPAR(1))
              where
                  lambda = wavelength in microns
                  lambda1 = 1 micron
                  AOD = aerosol optical depth at wavelength lambda 
                  AOD1 = aerosol optical depth at 1 micron (see Record A2.1.1).

        This is a version of Eq. 13 from  Molineaux et al, Appl. Optics, 1998.  The default values of 
        AERPAR(1), AERPAR(2), and AERPAR(3), which are 0, 1, and 0, respectively, yield an aerosol 
        with spectrally grey extinction.
 
        (Note:  To obtain Angstrom relation, set AERPAR(2)=1., AERPAR(3)=0., and AERPAR(1) equal to 
        Angstrom exponent.)

            LAY        layer number of aerosol layer.  (The layer numbering refers to the
                       ordering for the upward radiative transfer, i.e. bottom to top.
                       For IATM = 0 (Record 1.2), each layer's number is equal to the  
                       position of its Record 2.1.1 in the grouping of these records.
                       For example, the second Record 2.1.1 occurring after Record 2.1
                       corresponds to the second layer.  For IATM = 1 (Record 1.2) and 
                       IBMAX > 0 (Record 3.1), layer n corresponds to the region between 
                       altitudes n and n+1 in the list of layer boundaries in Record 3.3B.  
                       For IATM = 1 (Record 1.2) and IBMAX = 0 (Record 3.1), the layer 
                       numbers can be determined by running RRTM for the cloudless case
                       and examining the TAPE6 output from this run.(

 REPEAT RECORD A2.1.1 for the remaining layers containing this aerosol type. There should be NLAY

        SSA   Single scattering albedo for each band; must be equal to or greater than zero and 
              less than or equal to 1.  If ISSA equals 0, then only the first value of SSA (SSA(16))
              is considered.

 RECORD A2.3

                    14F5.2

        PHASE   Moments (starting with first moment) of the phase function for band IB.  In this implementation, 
                the phase function P(u) for each band is defined as 
                     P(u) = sum over streams l { (2l+1) (PHASE_l) (P_l(u)) }
                where
                     u = cos(theta)
                     PHASE_l = the lth moment of the phase function
                     P_l(u) = lth Legendre polynomial,
                and the number of streams to be used in DISORT (using the delta-M method) is determined 
                by the value of ISTRM in Record 1.2 of INPUT_RRTM.

                For IPHA = 0 or IPHA = 1, the Henyey-Greenstein phase function is used and only the first
                moment of the phase function needs to be specified, so only one Record A2.3 is read.
                (Note:  The first moment of the phase function is the asymmetry parameter.)  If IPHA equals
                0, then only the first value of PHASE (PHASE(16)) is considered.

                For IPHA = 2, the number of A2.3 records should be equal to the number of streams. 



 REPEAT RECORDS A2.1 through A2.3 for the remaining aerosol types.  There should be NAER
                       sets (A2.1 through A2.3) of records.
